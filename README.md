# tropen instrumenten

## Concept

This app is about music instruments in het Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam. The app focuses on musicians who want some inspiration for international (classic) instruments.

## How does it work?

When you land on the homepage of the application you can choose a continent which you find interesting. When clicking on the continent you get a list of countries in that continent which you can click on. After clicking on a country you see instruments that originate from this country. When clicking on one of the images get the detailpage of that instrument with a picture description etc.
